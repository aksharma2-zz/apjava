and Comments","keywords":"","body":"What is Java\nIntroduction and Java Packages\nJAVA was developed by Sun Microsystems Inc in 1991, later acquired by Oracle Corporation. Java is a simple platform independent programming language which is used to create modular and resuable programs. When Java code is compiled(understood by the computer), it is converted into byte code(machine language) which means it can be used across any Operating System like Windows, MAC OS, Linux, etc.\nEverything in Java uses Classes and Objects which makes up the building block of Objected Oriented Programming. We will cover about this topic in more detail as you progress through the course. For now, just think of a class as a concept and an object as instance/example of the concept. For eg. class - Car , object - Hyundai. Similarly, class - Animal, objects - Lion, Giraffe, Monkey, etc. For modularity purpose, we group similar classes into a common folder which is known as a package. A good example would be the inbuilt math package provided in Java. The math package provides us with classes which have different mathematical operations like for addition, subtraction, modulus remainder, etc. This is how its used\nimport java.lang.Math;\n\nSystem.out.print(Math.sqrt(25));\nBy importing the Math package, the programmer can use the inbuilt functions and operations defined by those packages.

The rules for an identifier are\n*    It cannot begin with a digit\n*    It is case sensitive (number is not the same as Number)\n*    It cannot be the same as a predefined keyword (for eg. cannot be int, this, boolean, etc.)\nThere are different data types of variables which Java allows us to declare which are\n1.    int - Whole number integers . For eg. -2, 5,1000\n2.    double - Decimals . For eg. -2.44, 455.124\n3.    boolean - True or False value . true or false only\n4.    float - Floating point value with lesser range than double . For eg., 1.5f, -444.2f (Not to be covered)\n5.    void - empty return type which doesn't return anything. For eg., adding two numbers but not displaying or using the final value\nType Casting\nType Casting is a feature used by Java which allows the compiler to change the data type of variables from one form into another. For eg., to type cast a double value into an int value. The code and their outputs are\nint a;\ndouble x,y,z,avg;\nboolean val;\n\na= 10;\nx= 3.6\ny=5.6;\nz=3;   // z will be assigned value of 3.00 as it is type double\n\navg = (x+y)/2;   // value of avg -> 4.6\navg = (int)avg;  // value of avg -> 4\nval = false; // will display false\na = (int)val // will have value 0 because in Java when you typecast boolean to int, false is 0 && true is 1\na = (int)x; // need to explicitly type case here to convert from double to int otherwise will cause compile time error\nNumber Storage\nJava uses bits(binary digits) to store integer values. \nFor type int\n*    Represented by four bytes(or 32 bits)\n*    ranges from (-2^31 to 2^(31)-1)\n*    Integer.MAX_VALUE keyword stores **maximum positive** int value\n*    Integer.MIN_VALUE keyword stores **maximum negative** int value\nHex and Octal numbers\nA hexadecimal number is one which uses base 16 for operations and as the name sounds, it has 16 symbols available to it which are from 0-9 and A-F where A represents 10, B represents 11 and so on till the end where F represents 15. It is also represented by a subscript of hex like AF8 (sub)hex(/sub). The conversion table from binary to hex and vice-versa is shown below. Please note that hex is always represented by 4 bits.\n\n![alt Oops something went wrong. Please reload](../../images/chapter_1/binary_hex_table.png \"Title\")\n\n\n```\n5 (hex) = 0101 (bin)\n0 (hex) = 0000 (bin)\n12(hex) = 1100 (bin)\n\n10110000 (bin) = 1011 0000\n               = B    0 (hex)\n\n1110010 (bin) = 0111 0010\n              = 7     2 (hex)\n\n```\n\nHow to convert from binary to hex? \n\n    *    Split the number into orders of 4 numbers starting from right to left. (If the number of digits are not in multiples of 4, add  preceding 0's to the left)\n    *    Depending on the position of the bit, multiply the value of the bit by 2^(position of the bit) and add all the bits' values. For eg.\n        ````\n        1100 (hex) = 1*2^(3) + 1*2^(2) + 0*2^(1) + 0*2^(0) = 8+4+0+0 = 12 = C (hex)\n        ```\n\nHow to convert from hex to decimal?\n\n    * Decimal numbers are represented by base 10 and are the usual numbers we use in daily life from 0-9\n    * Depending on the position of the hex digit, multiply the value of the bit by 16^(position of the hex digit) and all the hex digits' values. The same is done from octal values but instead it is multiple of 8^(position of the octal digit). **Also note that Octal values range from 0-8** For eg.\n        ```\n        B6(hex) = B*16^(1) + 6*16^(0) = 11*16 + 6*1 = 182 (dec)\n        120(oct) = 1*8^(2) + 2*8^(1) + 0*8^(0) = 64 + 16 + 0 = 80 (dec)\n        ```\nFinal variables\nA final variable is a special type of variable used as a constant which takes up one of the defined data types like any other variable but its value can only be defined once and cannot be changed later. **Also note that they are by norm, they are defined in capitals**.\n\n```\nfinal int PRICE_TAG;\nPRICE_TAG = 10;\nPRICE_TAG += 5; // will give compilation error\n```\n"},"curriculum/introduction/operators.html":{"url":"curriculum/introduction/operators.html","title":"Operators","keywords":"","body":"Operators\nOperators are special symbols used in Java to perform certain actions on variables and values.

They are categorized mainly into\n\nDecision making\nLoops\n\nDecision making\n\n\nIt is used to evaluate whether a condition matches a certain value and returns a boolean value using which we can carry out actions and decide which path to follow;\n*** THE if STATEMENT ***\n\n    The if statement is executed only if the condition is true otherwise it doesn't carry out the action. For eg.\n\n    ```\n    int x = 3;\n    if(x>=3){\n        System.out.print(\"value of x is\"+x);\n    }\n    System.out.print(\"\\t End program\");\n    ```\n\n    The above program prints : value of x is 3    End program \n    This is because since x is equal to 3, if condition is satisfied and carries out the actio which is enclosed by the parantheses\n\n*** The if...else STATEMENT ***\n\n    This is an extension of if but in this case we can specify another path which the computer we can take in case our condition was not true. For eg.\n\n    ```\n    int x=5;\n    if(x>10){\n        x=20;\n    }\n    else{\n        x=0;\n    }\n    System.out.print(\"value of x is +\"x); // prints value of x is 0\n    ```\n\n    *** THE if...elseif...else STATEMENT (EXTENDED if)\n\n    This is also like the previous cases except for this case we can specify multiple checking conditions.

It is meant to confuse you. From the indentation, it seems as if else condition is in continuum with the first if condition. However, it is continuum with the second if condition. This is because for just 1 statement after an if condition, it is not neccessary to add parantheses. However, it is a good practice to add proper indentation and parantheses to avoid these mistakes.\n\n    ```\n    int x=5;\n    int y=0;\n\n    if(x>0){\n        if(x%5==0){\n            y=10;\n        }\n    } \n    else{\n        y=20;\n    }\n\n    System.out.print(y); // prints 0 \n    ```\n\n    Now we can see, it is much more readable and the else condition is now in continuum with the first if condition. Now since the first if condition is satisfied, the else condition is never reached.\n\nLoops\n\nAs the name sounds, Loops are control structures used to execute repeated actions until the condition is evaluated to be false. The three main types of loops are\n\nfor LOOP\nwhile LOOP\nfor each LOOP (aka enhanced for LOOP)\n\nfor LOOP\n General form is : for(loop variable initilization; termination condition; update variable value){ do something }\n The termination condition is tested at the top of the loop i.e. the first step of the loop. The variable is updated at the end of the loop i.e. the last step of the loop. For eg.\n ```\n for(int i=0; i\n System.out.print(i);\n }\n // Prints 01234 . Take note that it does not print 5 because loop terminates as soon i becomes equal to 5 and loop works only if i is less than 5\n for(int index=20; index>=10; index=i-2){\n System.out.print(index+\" \"); // add extra space after every number printed \n }\n // Prints 20 18 16 14 12 10\n\nwhile LOOP\n The loop works almost the same way like the for loop but except the syntax is different. The general form is while(boolean test on variable){    \n do something\n *update variable\n }\n For eg.\n ```\n int index=0;\n while(index\n System.out.print(index);\n index++;\n }\n // Prints 01234\n\nfor each LOOP\n To understand this loop completely, we need to cover the topic of Arrays and Collections. However, think of it is a way that given a collection of items of a similar kind, the loop automatically traverses over the collection one by one till it reaches the end. The advantage of using this loop is the relatively easy syntax but however, it restricts freedom to write code our own way as it follows a particular convention. The general form is (variable : collection){ do something } For eg.\n ```\n int[]collection = {0,1,2,3,4};\n for(int i: collection){\n System.out.print(i);\n }\n // Prints 01234\n\n\n"},"curriculum/introduction/exc_handling.html":{"url":"curriculum/introduction/exc_handling.html","title":"Exception Handling","keywords":"","body":" Exception Handling \nAn exception is a special type of error which is produced during run time and not during compile time. What this means is that you will be the compiler will compile your program into bytecode but however it will break down during the execution of the program. For eg. if you divide any integer by 0, you will get a run time error aka exception. Exceptions in Java are classified into two types:\n\nUnChecked Exceptions\nChecked Exceptions\n\nUnchecked Exceptions \n This type of exception is automatically handled by Java's inbuilt exception handler and there is no need to write custom exception handler and program automatically terminates\n\nChecked Exceptions\n This type of exception needs to be handled by the user and the user needs to provide code to handle such exceptions\n\n\nThe division of exceptions is as follows\n\nThe main exceptions we will be covering for this course are\n\nArithmetic Exception \nNullPointer Exception\nClassCastException\nArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException\nIndexOutOfBoundsException\nIllegalArgumentException\n\nAs we go through the course, we will be covering all these exceptions one by one in more detail\n How to handle exception \n\nUsing throw - breaks the execution flow\n\n        if(divisor == 0){\n            throw new ArithmeticException(\"Cannot divide by zero\");\n        }\n\nUsing throws - Used while defining a method to indicate that the method might throw this kind of exception and is useful for handling Checked Exceptions\n\n        class Employee{\n            public int getSalary() throws MyPersonalException{\n                if(salary==0)\n                    throw MyPersonalException(\"What kind of job pays 0 salary?\");\n            }\n        }\n\nUsing try catch - try is used to detect sensitive and potential exceptions while catch is used to handle a particular exception if detected within try catch block and provide action to determine outcome of such an exception event.
